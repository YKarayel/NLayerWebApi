# NLayerWebApiAndMVC
This project was made with N Layer Architecture 3 brench.
<ul>
<li> First Brench: API only</li>
<li> Second Brench: Brench with only MVC (MVC Controller is directly connected to the database)</li>
<li> Third Brench: MVC requests the API and the result is published on the web via MVC.</li>
</ul>

This video belongs to Third Brench. Which is the scenario where both mvc and api are ready.
