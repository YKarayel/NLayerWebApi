# NLayerWebApiAndMVC
<h3>This project was made with N Layer Architecture 3 brench.</h3>
<ul>
<li> First Brench: ASP.NET-API only</li>
<li> Second Brench: Brench with only ASP.NET-MVC (MVC Controller is directly connected to the database)</li>
<li> Third Brench: MVC requests the ASP.NET-API and the result is published on the web via ASP.NET-MVC.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What API does offer and it's features ?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Basic CRUD operations and more</li>
  <li>NLayer Architecture</li>
  <li>DI and IOC Container (AutoFac)</li>
  <li>DTO's</li>

  <li>Global Exception Handlers</li>
  <li>Mapping</li>
  <li>Caching for stable performance</li>
  
</ul>
