# NLayerWebApiAndMVC
<h4>This project was made with N Layer Architecture 3 brench.</h4>
<ul>
<li> First Brench: ASP.NET-API only</li>
<li> Second Brench: Brench with only ASP.NET-MVC (MVC Controller is directly connected to the database)</li>
<li> Third Brench: MVC requests the ASP.NET-API and the result is published on the web via ASP.NET-MVC.</li>
</ul>

This video belongs to Third Brench. Which is the scenario where both mvc and api are ready.<br>
