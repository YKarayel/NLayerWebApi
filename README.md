# NLayerWebApiAndMVC
This project was made with N Layer Architecture 3 brench.

- First Brench: API only
- Second Brench: Brench with only MVC (MVC Controller is directly connected to the database)
- Third Brench: MVC requests the API and the result is published on the web via MVC.


This video belongs to Third Brench. Which is the scenario where both mvc and api are ready.
